**khan academy**

[khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/me/courses) is an app/website where it makes everything about math science and loads more subjects easier to learn and understand without paying nor glitching like most of the apps do.
But if you are searching for a lower kids level I would recommend paralell.[click here to check out](https://parallel.org.uk/)

**Mathway**

[Math way](https://www.mathway.com/Algebra) is an AI tool wich helps with all algebric equation that are very hard for you and explain how you do it.

**parallel by simon singh**

[parallel](https://parallel.org.uk/) is basicly like khan academy it teaches you loads of math, but whats speical about this website is that the videos they show are in [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)  wich you can save, and whenever you need for reviewing you can go back to those videos again.

## year 1-6 needs for math

**Grade 1 (Age 6–7):**

Addition and Subtraction: Focus on numbers up to 20, using objects or drawings to visualize math problems.

Place Value: Understanding the value of digits in numbers (e.g., 23 means 2 tens and 3 ones).

Basic Word Problems: Solving simple real-world addition and subtraction problems.

Shapes and Geometry: Identifying 2D and 3D shapes (squares, circles, rectangles, cubes, spheres, etc.).

Measurement: Understanding and using non-standard units to measure length, weight, and volume.

Time: Telling time to the hour and half-hour using analog clocks.

**Year 2 (Ages 6-7)**

Focus: Expanding on number skills and introducing more complex operations.

Number and Place Value

Recognizing and writing numbers up to 100.
Understanding tens and ones in two-digit numbers.
Counting in 2s, 5s, and 10s.
Addition and Subtraction

Adding and subtracting within 100, with an emphasis on mental math and using number lines.
Solving word problems involving addition and subtraction.
Introduction to addition and subtraction facts within 20.
Multiplication and Division (Introduction)

Introduction to multiplication as repeated addition (e.g., 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 → 3 × 3 = 9).
Learning basic division as sharing (e.g., 12 ÷ 4 = 3).
Understanding the concept of equal groups.
Measurement

Using standard units of measurement for length (cm, m), weight (g, kg), and capacity (ml, l).
Telling time to the nearest 5 minutes on an analog clock.
Introduction to money: using coins and notes to make amounts.
Geometry

Recognizing and describing properties of 2D shapes (e.g., sides, corners).
Introduction to simple symmetry.
Identifying 3D shapes and their properties (e.g., cubes, cylinders, pyramids).
Data and Probability

Sorting and classifying objects based on their properties.
Collecting data and using tally charts.
Reading simple bar graphs and pictograms.
