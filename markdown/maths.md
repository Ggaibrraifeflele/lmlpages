**khan academy**

[khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/me/courses) is an app/website where it makes everything about math science and loads more subjects easier to learn and understand without paying nor glitching like most of the apps do.
But if you are searching for a lower kids level I would recommend paralell.[click here to check out](https://parallel.org.uk/)

**Mathway**

[Math way](https://www.mathway.com/Algebra) is an AI tool wich helps with all algebric equation that are very hard for you and explain how you do it.

**parallel by simon singh**

[parallel](https://parallel.org.uk/) is basicly like khan academy it teaches you loads of math, but whats speical about this website is that the videos they show are in [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)  wich you can save, and whenever you need for reviewing you can go back to those videos again.
